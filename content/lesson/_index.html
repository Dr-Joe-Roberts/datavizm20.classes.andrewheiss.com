<p>Each class session has an interactive lesson that you will work through <strong><em>after</em></strong> doing the readings and watching the lecture. These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use <strong>ggplot2</strong> and other packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong> to create beautiful and truthful visualizations with R.</p>
<p>Interactive code sections look like this. Make changes in the text box and click on the green “Run Code” button to see the results. Sometimes there will be a button with a hint or solution.</p>
<div class="puzzle">
<p><strong>Your turn</strong>: Modify the code here to show the relationship between health and wealth for 2002 instead of 2007.</p>
