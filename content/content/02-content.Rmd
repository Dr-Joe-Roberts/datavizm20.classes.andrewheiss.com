## Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chapter 5 in Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art* [@Cairo:2016]
- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 4](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/color-basics.html) and [Chapter 22](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html) in Claus Wilke, *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@Wilke:2018]
- <i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> [Summary of CRAP graphic design principles](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf) from Garr Reynolds, *Presentation Zen* [@Reynolds:2008]. These principles are from Robin Williams' [*The Non-Designer's Design & Type Books*](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-4th/dp/0133966151) [@Williams:2008], which you should really get if you're interested in doing anything design-related ever. Her stuff is life-changing.
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Typography in ten minutes](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html). The rest of the *Practical Typography* book is phenomenal and you'd be remiss if you didn't read the whole thing and bookmark it for life, but for now just read this quick summary.
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> ["What's the Difference Between JPG, PNG, and GIF?"](https://gizmodo.com/5656669/whats-the-difference-between-jpg-png-and-gif)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> ["The File Guide: Differences Between JPG, PNG, EPS, PDF, PSD, AI, GIF, TIFF"](https://builtbytophat.com/file-guide-differences-between-jpg-png-eps-pdf-psd-ai-gif-tiff/)

### Questions to reflect on

- Why does graphic design matter when conveying truth?
- What makes something well designed (vs. poorly designed)?
